# Generalized-CV-Tracking-Algorithm

## Vishnu Dasaka

This program is a generalized CV object tracking algorithm that attempts to be rotation, scale, brightness, and background invariant using non ML based computer vision techniques.

The program takes as input a target picture of the object to be tracked in a different setting and environment as the source video. The algorithm will then be able to track the object within the video disregarding the differences between the environments of the object.
